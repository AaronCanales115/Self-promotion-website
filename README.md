# Self-promotion-website
Millestone project 3 of the UNLV Software Development Bootcamp 

# Inspiration: 
I inspired myself to make this app because there are a lot of people who have hidden talents, so I would like to make it easy for them to share their talents with more people.

# How to use the app: 
In order to use the app, if you don't have an account, you can create one to explore the businesses that people have published. You will need to create an account with an email and password, your first name, and your last name to use the rest of the app's functions, like publishing your own business.
